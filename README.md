tic-tac-toe game

Simple terminal based tic-tac-tcoe game.

Run main.py to begin playing the game. The prgoram has one optional argument, -s/--size, which will determine the size of the board and the win condition.
For example, if 5 is specified, the game board will be 5x5, and a player must get 5 entries in a row to win.
The default size is 3, and no value will be taken below 3 or above 10.

The program will ask which letter player 1 would like to use, X or O. If no valid choice is entered, X will be assigned to player 1.

Once the game is complete, the program allow you to play another game with the same board size.

Enjoy!
